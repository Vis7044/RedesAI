355,@Joy.Elizabeth,Thanks Judo! I was looking for ur video to see if supercell was going to bring back enough medals to get even 1 obstacle.  I've been playing for over 10 years n am th17 but just been frustrated with how they keep nerfing ftp players. Esp w events like these. Could you maybe pass along player frustration in not giving us enough medals to get  even 1 obstacle(with the equipment)? they used to give enough for 2 then 1 n now none. it's only 400 extra medals and would go a long way I feel. Either way I really appreciate your videos n always share your channel w my clan. hope you have a Merry Christmas! ,0
