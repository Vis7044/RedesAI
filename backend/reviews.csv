1,@PeterSzpiriev,"60 memorable games by Bobby Fischer. Perhaps best book about chess, very sharp and very genius. Chess is a subject  analysed  for death! At least concrete, i like Lasker Emanuel and his defense, Also Hungarian Maroczy Géza! They cane to team Morphy and Steinitz! :) i did not knew much of Smyslov yet",0

45,@michaeldedonato-hd2je,"Estimating Bobby Fischer's rating in 2024, considering Elo inflation, is a complex task that involves several assumptions and approximations. Elo inflation refers to the general increase in ratings over time, partly due to a larger player pool, improved training methods, and better understanding of the game. Here are some steps and considerations for making an estimate:1. **Historical Comparison**: Look at the ratings of top players during Fischer's peak and compare them to modern ratings.2. **Elo Inflation Estimates**: Use existing studies or estimates of Elo inflation over the decades.3. **Performance Comparison**: Compare Fischer's performance and dominance to that of modern top players.### Historical Comparison- **Fischer's Peak Rating**: Fischer's peak rating was 2785 in 1972.- **Top Ratings in 1972**: The top ratings at that time were around Fischer's level. For instance, Boris Spassky, whom Fischer defeated, had a rating of around 2660.- **Modern Top Ratings**: As of 2024, the top ratings are above 2800, with Magnus Carlsen having reached a peak rating of 2882.### Elo Inflation Estimates- Various studies suggest an Elo inflation of about 3-5 points per year. If we take a midpoint of 4 points per year:  - From 1972 to 2024 is 52 years.  - 52 years * 4 points/year = 208 points.### Performance Comparison- Fischer's dominance in his era can be compared to Magnus Carlsen's in the modern era. Both had periods of clear dominance over their peers.### Estimated RatingAdding the inflation estimate to Fischer's peak rating:- 2785 (Fischer's peak) + 208 (inflation adjustment) = 2993.Given this rough estimation, Bobby Fischer's rating in 2024, adjusted for Elo inflation, might be around **2990-3000**. However, this is a speculative figure and actual performance against modern players would be needed for a precise rating.",0

21,@Navii-05,"Hello. So, what I want to do with this message is to simply show what the Gospel is. I am not trying to force my belief down people's throats. It's your choice whether you want to accept it. Please read the whole text.So, a question: Do you think you are a good person? If so, have you ever stolen anything, lied, looked lustfully, watched adult material? All of those are sins and anyone who sinned is not good(on God's standard). You, I and most( most because babies don't sin, and maybe specifically mentally Ill people) purely human beings have violated God's moral law. Since God is just, He can't let sin go just like that.So is there any hope? Yes, there is. Out of love and mercy, God became a human being, Jesus Christ. Jesus lived a sinless life and finally died on the cross to bear the punishment we deserve, we deserve to be punished because we have sinned. The reason why blood must be spilled for forgiveness of sins is because the life of the flesh is in the blood, in the Old Testament Jews sacrificed animals for sins but the sacrifice of animals were enough to temporarily cover some sins. (it did not allow forgiveness of sins, unlike Jesus's, it only temporarily covered them). Jesus is the Lamb of God, the ultimate sacrifice for sins which is enough for all sins that have been done, are done and will be done. Jesus was buried and rose again. His resurrection proved that His death was enough to pay our penalty, the penalty for our sins. Jesus paid our penalty and in order to accept the free gift of salvation from God, we must trust in Jesus's spilled Blood, His finished work on the Cross for our Salvation. And then your sins will be forgiven because of what Christ did, you will be saved.    See:  Romans 3:1 , Romans 3:23 , Romans 5:12 , Romans 6:23 , Romans 5:8-9, Romans 10:9-10 , Ephesians 2:8-9 KJV, John 3:16 KJV, Leviticus 17:11 ,  Ephesians 1:7 , Colossians 1:20, 1 Corinthians 15:1-4 .",0
