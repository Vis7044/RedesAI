You MUST have heard by now that English spoken by Indians, is: A) Moderately difficult to understand no matter what the speed, tone, or dialect being used. B) Exponentially MORE difficult to understand/keep up with the faster it's spoken!Just SLOW down! You'll get many more likes, which then  becomes more exposure, hence views, hence $$$! SLOW DOWN!Edit: spelling",0
