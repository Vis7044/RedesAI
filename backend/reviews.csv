19,@CaptainFalcon92,Css is simple. By its core nature. Tailwind and other utility classes libraries kills the natural reusability and flexibility of css by setting your design in stone. It simply goes against what css has best to offer. It grew in popularity because of the flood of pseudo-devs who stormed this industry by spitting one-offs fire-and-forget projects.,1

32,@SebastianWeinberg,"Oh jeez!  I take one look at classes like ""text-center"", ""font-bold"", and ""text-green"", and the first thing that goes through my mind is, ""You just spent an inordinate amount of work to undermine the very reason why classes exist, in order to return to manually styling elements straight inside the HTML source, exactly like using the 'style' attribute — only less flexible and more convoluted.""The whole god​dam​n point of CSS classes is to take the exact styling minutiae out of the HTML elements!  What happens when the project owner decides at the last minute that green text just isn't right and everything has to be purple instead?  You either have to go through all the elements in all the files that you annotated with ""text-green"", change them all to ""text-purple"", and hope you don't miss any or accidentally mess something up — or you have to edit the definition of ""text-green"" to produce purple text, thereby undermining the very existence of that class, and proving why you should have used a semantic name in the first place.This kind of silliness drove me nuts, when I worked in web-development, 10 years ago – and we're still not past that?!",3

93,@BrianHayesOfficial,"I love the utility concept, however, the implementation is awful. Even with the fake postCSS dependent “@apply” option. Also I find nothing more tedious than giant config/theme files that are never easy to maintain. While sass can suffer this too, I think the approach needs to be a base set of variables that can filter down to a greater theme through an actual design language vs tediously changing and managing every variable. As an example: color themes. Maybe pick 1-3 primary colors and then have a full palette generated for use as variables. Can it be edited at all levels? Sure, but the power of just being able to change some basic design principles and build out an entire design document from that seems better in the end.The greatest problem with that is people defaulting to similar designs and everything being a repeat of the bootstrap effect, however if the system can do enough to base a unique theme around a few high level variables, then it really can come down to the application of utility styles implemented in specific components vs generic ready-made components.It’s not an easy problem given the nature of CSS, but tailwind just seems like a way to get things done without any understanding of what is being done, while making maintainability a nightmare  all over again:",0

Bootstrap does offer the same tooling as tailwind in bs4 and bs5, plus you get extra so you spend much less on desing and continue coding. I tried tailwind but I’ve basically had all my components created to match BS like forms, btns, and cards… tailwind is for an approach where you are doing new designs. I’d rather use bootstrap to serve me side navs, easy layouts and more instead of creating my own components.",0

IMO it's for ppl who hate CSS, don't want to learn it, and love having unreadable html documents.If you want to change a color of your palette, you have to search and replace it x times in the html AND the css. With basic css you just change 1 variable in root and it's done.""But you can still use class and @apply"" ? So really what's the point of tailwind then ? writing css files with fake css only working with a specific framework and no tools to convert it to pure css? What a great idea.At least with sass you can compile it to css and there's very cool features (like mixins just to name one)I'm using it right now in a project, and I clearly hope that I'll never have to deal with it again.",0

And?I can literally abstract anything, normal css, css modules, jss, styled components, shadow dom etc.You also bloat your html so its not like you are gaining anything with that logic of ""i never write css, i just use existing css"" either...Tailwind sucks with complexity as well. Imagine adding bunch of stuff for animation etc, either it will look super retarded with TW or you just create normal css files besides that,  but then you have both tw and css files and you are in a mess.Also people are like wohoo: tw added a possibility to set things to 13px instead of using predefined measures in the config, with some strange ""[-]"" syntax or whatever...If only i could do that with normal css, oh wait i could do that for the last 30 years.Imagine writting inline classes and then using apply so you apply those inline classes as normal class. You could just use, you know, a normal class lmao.I rather just use svelte and its ""scoped css"" in the same file and thats it.But devs rather complicate everything with their shit flows and dependencies and purging...I have even seen people using styled-components with a macro so they can write inline tw utilities inside a styled-component. If that is normal to anyone, you should check your brain.And yes i have used it several times and never will do that again.It maybe makes sens for some smaller apps, imagine like a web email client where you dont care about specific design, just clap some buttons inside boxes to look non retarded and usable.",1

For me, the difference between using Tailwind vs vanilla CSS is the difference between being able to create a sword by learning how to blacksmith vs 3D printing one. To be clear here, I'm not saying that it takes less skill to use or that you aren't a good developer if you use it - there are people lightyears ahead of my skills with CSS that use frameworks. I'm just saying I have a preference for vanilla CSS and don't much like the obfuscation. This is also only a ""CSS thing"" for me.

49,@thetarnav,It's also worth mentioning that it has great documentation.,1
50,@adamhenriksson6007,"The thing with tailwind is that it's literally the same thing as HTML inline styles but worse. You cannot copy paste CSS or import CSS from third party design tools or design extensions. Also you still need CSS for animations. Just use figma if you want to design fast, or material if you want prebuilt CSS.",1
