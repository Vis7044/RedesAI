80,@imyasharya,"1:01 Problem Solving is about thinking on the challenge, coming up with a solution, implementing it, noting the flaws, reiterating on the solution, implementing it again, and the cycle continues until you get the desired outcomes (or very close to it).

87,@sifatislam5908,"I understand that you are trying to say when you do real life projects that converts to product is actual problem solving But when you are building that level of products you have to have that thinking level so that it becomes an useful product otherwise making same old project does not makes any sense even Todo list project can be a million $ project if it solves people's problem that are missing from existing project and there are other marketing policies too. The biggest problem of your video is you made a generalized view but it should not it can make misconception to the students who are trying to enter into the industry.let's say a person is doing math olympiad and doing pretty good at it. How will it prevent you from being a good engineer? it won't .right?? it only can help if you are not dumb and not love software engineering. Competitive Programming  is also same like this if you don't do this and pretty good at logic then absolutely fine but if you do, it only can help you. it makes you better at thinking and its also possible that you are pretty good at logic without doing cp which is fine. but who are not much good at logic how will they be good at logic just doing project but how this kind of project will test the solution the student came up with. who is going to give verdict that the solution he came up with is absolutely nonsense or absolutely genius ? may b he will assume that he made 5-6 projects and pretty good at logic which is not and enter into the industry with wrong perception and will make him cost for long time.If you do projects its fine but you have to ensure the code you are writing actually making sense and there should be test criteria otherwise you will always think your solution is fine.my suggestion is try to sharpen your logic sense by doing anything. CP is just a great tool to make you better at logic and the harsh truth is only for getting job doing cp is kind of impossible because you need immense level of patience to continue.",0
