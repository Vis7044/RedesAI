80,@MinshikSeries,"reason why ironheart sucksWhy Ironheart Struggles to Connect with AudiencesIntroductionWhen Marvel introduced Riri Williams, known as Ironheart, she was pitched as a new generation's Iron Man‚Äîa young genius with a passion for tech, bravery, and a strong moral compass. Her debut created excitement, especially given her status as one of Marvel‚Äôs first Black female superheroes to take on a leading role in her own right. However, her storylines and character development have often been met with mixed reviews. Critics have voiced concerns over her rapid rise, perceived lack of depth, and uneven writing across various media. Additionally, her controversial, violent confrontation with Atlanteans in some comics further clouded the character's appeal for some readers. Let‚Äôs break down the reasons why Ironheart has struggled to find a solid fanbase and why some of her actions have sparked debate.---The Challenges of a Legacy CharacterRiri Williams, as Ironheart, is a clear attempt at creating a legacy character who carries on Tony Stark‚Äôs ideals while giving her a fresh, youthful perspective. However, fans of the original Iron Man often feel that the mantle of Iron Man (or a similar one) cannot be passed on so quickly. Tony Stark‚Äôs journey is rich and layered, marked by personal struggles, sacrifices, and victories. Riri, by contrast, was introduced with a lot of potential but not enough backstory to make her rise feel earned. This has led some fans to see her as more of a ‚Äústand-in‚Äù than an original character in her own right.---Perceived Lack of Originality and DepthOne key critique of Riri Williams is that she lacks a distinct personality or storyline that makes her truly stand out. As a teenage tech genius, she shares many traits with Tony Stark but doesn‚Äôt yet have a unique path or flaw that sets her apart in the same impactful way. Fans connected with Tony because he was deeply flawed: his story arc dealt with addiction, struggles with responsibility, and moments of true vulnerability. In contrast, Riri's character has not faced these same gritty challenges, and this perceived simplicity can make her come off as less compelling.Without a strong, original story arc, Riri‚Äôs character risks becoming a ‚Äúcarbon copy‚Äù rather than a genuinely fresh addition to the Marvel roster. In comics and TV, compelling heroes don‚Äôt just fight villains; they confront their own flaws, grow, and evolve. This is an aspect of Ironheart‚Äôs character that some fans feel is missing, making her feel too ‚Äúpolished‚Äù or ‚Äúidealized‚Äù in comparison.---Violence in Her Conflict with the AtlanteansOne of the storylines that drew a lot of fan reaction was Riri‚Äôs violent clash with the Atlanteans. While superheroes often face morally gray choices, Ironheart's approach to this particular conflict raised eyebrows due to the level of aggression she displayed. Instead of showing the calculated, thoughtful tactics fans associate with Iron Man, Riri‚Äôs response came across as impulsive and brutal to some readers. Her quick decision to escalate the violence made her appear less of a measured strategist and more reactive‚Äîa trait that some critics feel doesn‚Äôt align with her role as Iron Man‚Äôs successor.This scene also prompted fans to question whether her aggression was a result of inexperienced writing or an intentional, but misguided, attempt to make her seem tougher and more ‚Äúbattle-ready.‚Äù Many fans appreciate complexity in their heroes, including moments of restraint, humility, and introspection. However, Riri‚Äôs handling of the Atlanteans seemed like a misstep, giving audiences more of a reactionary character than the calm, self-controlled demeanor they expected from someone wielding a high-tech suit.---Inconsistent Writing and Portrayals Across MediaPart of the struggle for Ironheart‚Äôs character has been inconsistent portrayal across her different media appearances. In her initial comics, Riri is introduced as a young, brilliant inventor, a bit unsure but determined to make a difference. In later comics, and in her adaptation in the MCU, Riri‚Äôs character traits and motivations sometimes feel tweaked to fit new narratives. Her moments of moral questioning or struggle are sidelined, and instead, we see a character who often feels ready to jump into any conflict.This shift in characterization can make it difficult for fans to truly invest in Riri‚Äôs journey. Fans who connect with one version of Riri may not see the same character in other versions. Writing inconsistencies make it hard for a character to feel grounded or relatable, and in Riri‚Äôs case, the potential for a strong, layered character is often undermined by a lack of unified storytelling.---Where Ironheart Could Go from HereDespite the criticisms, Ironheart still holds a lot of promise. If Marvel leans into her character‚Äôs growth and gives her storylines that allow for vulnerability, mistakes, and genuine learning, she could evolve into a standalone hero with her own unique voice. Addressing her sometimes impulsive decision-making and giving her more opportunities to confront her flaws could deepen her character, helping her win over audiences who may still feel hesitant about her role in the Marvel universe.Ultimately, legacy characters have a challenging role to fill. They must pay homage to the original hero while crafting their own path. With more consistent storytelling and greater focus on her unique challenges and personality, Riri Williams might yet emerge as a complex and relatable character in her own right. Ironheart has all the right ingredients to become a fan favorite if given the space and development needed to truly shine.also iron heart is a monkey it should be Harley kinner",1

So today I tell you why you are here so first of all keep in mind your creation is not useless because nobody needs to creates you for some years & your game is over, because it makes no sense to born, suffer & die there's some purpose of our creation but we can't understand it, we busy in our daily routine suffer anxiety, depression, pain but don't think about the reason why we are here to suffer can we born just to suffer different types of pains & die No absolutely not we are not useless our creation is not useless there is a purpose of our life & our Creator is Super excellent & his creativity has no limits so he can't make us for limited time he created us for unlimited time but we can't see because we just know life till death but in real it's very tiny part our real life has no time span but on earth we live for limited time so you should understand there's a some logic of life but mostly people doesn't believe this but you think if there is no life after death so it's injustice because anyone who murder people but enjoy his life but on other hands the victim loss his life so how justice become because the person who died have right to live suppose if we say court punished the killer but who compansate the victim of his remaining life enjoyment his children & wife suffers so who compansate them give punishment is not compansation but just maintain rule of law to stop crimes because the person who lost his father, son, husband or brother can't get back by punishment of killer. So if we think logically so there should be a system that compansate the people who suffer huge pain or loss in life but get no reward from earth suppose a girl raped & murdered in minor age  so who gives her remaining life nobody because she die either rapist got jailed but what's for that girl that was no more so there should be a system and I swear this system 100% exist because without this system nobody gets full justice & this system works after life means after your death but don't worry about death the word death is so fearful but believe me this is only fearful for those who hurts other but those who are good person in life so death is a beautiful gift for them because they are rewarded after death but there is some conditions of all of this. & I assure you that you fullfil all these conditions in just one minute with no cost amazing! So I hope nobody loss this opportunity because it's totally free & no time taking just one minute of your life only belief matters so there is just things you keep in mind first you belief that there's a creator who create all the system of universe & other things and he is God(Allah). Second he send Prophets to people to educate them and on last he send Prophet Muhammad SAW & he is last. Third things is tobelieve on afterlife, sky angels & sky books. Over now you are a part of amazing reality but remember if you hurts anyone you will be punish afterlife but if you give happiness to people like helping poor feed orphans & stop cruelty in society & play positive rule among people so remember great reward waiting for you in heaven where you live forever no death no pain no anxiety depression just enjoy endless life there, but to get this you need to become a very positive person in world because negative person deserve hell become a person who brings smile on people face not tears.Friends If you don't agree with me on that points so just think all the points I mentioned are good or bad if you agree that all person should be good & positive so my point is same to you so I request you to please give only one minute to these three points and accept it with your heart and mind & get long term benefit so it gives you huge success but the main point is to just believe & be positive Thanks A64",0

67,@yj7jjjuk5fghira,"‚ÄúOne of the Most Evil Activities on This Planet Today‚Äù Chris Smith is a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from New Jersey‚Äôs 4th district. Smith has chaired over 85 congressional hearings and markups on China‚Äôs human rights abuses, including a hearing last year that helped expose the Chinese regime‚Äôs forced organ harvesting of prisoners while they are still alive. ‚ÄúNowhere is the principle of utter disregard for the dignity of the human person, and of using people as a utilitarian means to an end, more apparent than in the horrific practice of harvesting the organs of human beings, even before they meet the standard of brain death,‚Äù Smith said at the time. He called on the U.S. Congress to pass a legislation against the atrocity. Speaking of Falun Gong practitioners who were persecuted for their faith, Smith said, ‚ÄúWe admire their courage and commitment in the face of such oppression.‚Äù The first hearing was held in Congress on September 12, 2012, titled ‚ÄúOrgan Harvesting of Religious and Political Dissidents by the Chinese Communist Party.‚Äù Dana Rohrabacher, chair of the Committee on Foreign Affairs who hosted the meeting, said that forced organ harvesting ‚Äúis probably one of the most evil activities on this planet today.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis is a crime against humanity. We should do our best to identify those specific individuals who are engaged in this and put them on the list of people to observe to be brought to justice,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúAnd specifically, that does not exclude Americans who are willing accomplices to this crime against humanity.‚Äù Then-Congress members Chris Smith, Nancy Pelosi, Frank Wolf, and others attended the hearing. At that time, two Chinese doctors, Zhou Weizhang and Qian Xiaojiang, testified. They said the victims could be killed directly for their organs.  Smith condemned forced organ harvesting by the CCP in March 2020. During the policy forum, titled ‚ÄúOrgan Procurement and Extrajudicial Killing in China,‚Äù held at the U.S. Capitol on March 10, 2020, Smith condemned the CCP for its forced organ harvesting from prisoners of conscience. He and other Congress members called on the United States and other governments, medical institutions, and human rights organizations to launch comprehensive investigations and actions to end the crime of forced organ harvesting in China. He said the CCP's appalling Nazi-style behavior is mainstream in China. Dissidents and those who the Party does not like, such as Falun Gong practitioners and Uyghurs, are targeted for their organs. It was shocking that detained Falun Gong practitioners would escape such killings only by having a poor health. The China Tribunal established by the International Coalition to End Transplant Abuse in China (ETAC) made a ruling in June 2019. In the final judgment, British lawyer Sir Geoffrey Nice spoke of this crime by the CCP. ‚ÄúForced organ harvesting has been committed for years throughout China on a significant scale and Falun Gong practitioners have been one - and probably the main - source of organ supply,‚Äù he wrote in the judgment. Canada passed Bill S-223 into law on December 14, 2022, to create new offenses in relation to trafficking in human organs. It also amends the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act to provide that a permanent resident or foreign national is inadmissible to Canada if they commit the crime of human organ trafficking. Similarly, Israel, Taiwan, Italy, and Spain have also banned organ tourism.",0

My mom and sister wanted me to just snap out of it because they could not understand how i was feeling. Then one day i was alone in my mom's room laying across my mom bed crying. Then I felt a strong hand on my back holding me down, then I heard a multitude of angels singing the most beautiful song i ever heard before, I knew it was a multitude of angel but they were so nsync with each other that it sounded as if it was one. After that the hand lifted off of me and the depression I had for 2 years was automatically gone.  CALL OUT TO JESUSNOT ONLY DOES JESUS SAVES YOUR SOUL, BUT HE FILLS THAT DEEP EMPTY INSIDE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN TRYING YEARS TO SATISFY WITH WORLDY DESIRES, THAT GRATIFIED YOU FOR A WHILE , JUST TO RETURN WITH A VENGEANCE, WHEN JESUS FILLS YOU WILL NEVER AGAIN FILL THAT EMPTINESS.",1

74,@johnpearson1258,"Romans 3:23 states: ""For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;"". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 ""But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death."". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: ""Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me."". Romans 10:13 states ""For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."".     Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.",1

EVEN S2)The Friendly Neighborhood Spiderman I really wish didn't exist. I know people will love it and now I will have to argue against not ONE fandom(Spectacular Spidey) but TWO fandoms over why I think Ultimate Spiderman is the perfect spiderman showIronheart looks alright but I see no Mephisto/""Dark Magic"" stuff so until then idcMarvel Zombies is a continuation of the What If episode which is a huge miss. Like really, nobody asked for a talking paul rudd antman headSpeaking of I don't really care that much about What IfWonderman looks like supacell of all things (6/10 show) so it will probably be just another Ms Marvel for the MCU or smth. Also why bring back Trevor from Shang Chi?? He was pretty mid in Shang Chi but at least he kind of had a purposeEyes of Wakanda I never really cared for either Black Panther movie so idc about this eitherSo far, I'm only really excited for Spiderman 4, Avengers Doomsday and Secret Wars, Fantastic 4 and Captain America 4 I think that's all",1

And if I recall, that show will be its own Earth.Speaking of racewashing, Wonder Man is in a weird grey area. There's this one comic pic of Ultimates Wonder Man that looked black( & the guy being a former actor is the Ultimates origin), but in every other comic page the guy is white. An artist REALLY screwed up, to the point that the top search result for Ultimates Wonder Man is the exact pic Im talking about. So, someone at Marvel Studios saw that pic of that version of the character & thought Ultimates Wonder Man was black, so they can roll with that & reserve the original for a Variant.",0

They do nothing with the creative medium of animation and they are owned by Disney !!! BTW, I was talking about ""Eyes of Wakanda"" being the only fascinating one (ironically looks like the only thing that they have put effort in). The Spider-Man show looks poorly made, ""What If ... ?"" is a total failure of a concept and ""ZOMBIES"", well should I even explain.As for live-action shows, I genuinely don't care. It has been and is going to be some slop for a long time as most of these shows were in development hell and were reshot so many times that I doubt anything is professionally. I don't have any hopes of ay of them being unique and they are all basically like ""Star Wars"" shows on Disney+, best part in trailers although niche or awful in execution.",1
