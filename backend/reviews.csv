While DeepSeek-R1's innovative approach is promising, the phi-4 model consistently outperformed it in this specific task.

I have right now an issue and many other developers had it in the past and I don't see someone mainstream discuss this, I hope you read this comment and can dig a bit into it, I think it needs public discussion. Google Play is discriminating developers without reason! I wanted to submit my first ever app to the Play Store but one day after that my account got terminated without warning, because of ""prior violations"". I never had an account before and they don't tell my what I should have violated. Send an appeal is hopeless, now I am for ever banned from Google Play without publishing ever an app and Google gives nothing about it, that is very frustrating. When you search online there are many other reports from developers that experienced this issue. I am very happy to share with you more details if you are interested and I am very sorry to send you this but I think more public attention is needed for this.If everyone read this, pleas upvote the comment, this is a real problem and no one can touch Google right now",1

92,@UohdjinVubdferkun,"AI is a tool for recycling data; that is all. That's why the products it generates aren't impressive, because they're just old products recycled. ChatGPT would have been very impressive 20 years ago when the internet wasn't overwhelmed with billions of conversations and with thousands of answers for every question imaginable—the same conversations and Q&A that have been fed to the ChatGPT neural network. You can literally see recycled answers from Reddit or Quora in ChatGPT answers. People who are impressed with AI-generated crappy videos and images (crappy without a single exception) are impressed because they think of it as something that AI produces from thin air; they are not aware of how tremendously huge the database from which that AI's been fed is. So that is all about AI—data recycling. It can just recycle old data; it can't create anything new. But the point is: today's industries depend on recycling old products because they are incapable of answering demands for the new ones. So, they recycle novels, songs, movies, music, games, apps, etc. That's why they need AI as a cheap solution for that problem. Everything else is just a fairy tale. AI is a terrible learner of doing some job, e.g. it needs hours or days to learn how to play a very simple game, a game for which a bot could be created with few lines of code. So AI is worth no more and no less than data recycling is worth.",0

98,@mladenpopovicphoto,"So many comments: Tell me about Tiananmen square 1989, it answers without problem ( r1 qwen 32B) <think>Alright, so I'm trying to understand what happened on Tiananmen Square in 1989. I've heard about it before, but I don't know much details. I guess it was a significant event in Chinese history, but I'm not sure why. First off, who were the people involved? Was it just students or were there other groups too? I think it had something to do with protests, maybe demanding changes in government policies or more freedom. But why would that lead to such a big event? I also remember hearing that there was some sort of crackdown by the authorities. How did that go down? Were there many people affected? What were the consequences for those involved? And what about the aftermath? Did things return to normal after the protests, or did it leave lasting effects on Chinese society and politics? I wonder if it's still a sensitive topic today. There’s also the international reaction—how did other countries respond to what happened in Tiananmen Square? Was there widespread condemnation, or were some nations more cautious in their response? Overall, I want to get a clearer picture of the events leading up to 1989, what actually took place on Tiananmen Square, and how it has influenced China since then. It seems like a pivotal moment that shaped modern Chinese history, but I need to delve deeper into the specifics.</think> The events at Tiananmen Square in 1989 were a significant and tragic moment in Chinese history. Here's a summary of what transpired: - **Protesters**: The protests began with students from universities in Beijing, who were advocating for political reform, greater freedom of speech, and an end to government corruption. They were later joined by workers, intellectuals, and other members of the public. - **Government Crackdown**: On June 3-4, 1989, the Chinese government declared martial law and sent troops into Beijing. The military used live ammunition to suppress the protests, resulting in numerous casualties among both demonstrators and bystanders. - **Casualties**: Exact numbers are difficult to determine due to censorship, but estimates suggest that hundreds, possibly thousands of people were killed during the crackdown. - **Consequences**: The suppression of the Tiananmen Square protests led to a tightening of political control by the Chinese government. Many participants in the demonstrations were arrested, imprisoned, or went into exile. The event has had lasting effects on Chinese society and politics. - **International Reaction**: The violence at Tiananmen Square was met with widespread condemnation from the international community. Many countries imposed sanctions on China following the crackdown. In summary, the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 were a pivotal moment in modern Chinese history, marked by government suppression and significant loss of life. The event remains a sensitive topic within China and continues to be remembered internationally as a symbol of the struggle for freedom and democracy.",0

71,@Eisenbrei,"The 1.5b parameter model gave the following answer to the strawberry question:<think>Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how many times the letter ""r"" is in the word ""strawberry."" Hmm, let's see. Iknow that ""strawberry"" has a few letters, mostly consonants and sometimes some vowels like 'a' or 'u.' First, I'll write down the word: S T R A W B E R R Y. Let me count each letter one by one. So starting from thebeginning: 1. The first letter is 'S,' which isn't an 'r.'2. Next is 'T,' also not an 'r.'3. Then there's a 'R' in the middle of the word. That's definitely an 'r.' So that's my first one.4. After that, we have 'A,' another vowel but not an 'r.'5. The next letter is 'W,' which doesn't count either. Now moving on to the second half of the word:6. 'B' comes after 'W,' still no 'r.'7. Then there's an 'E,' which isn't relevant here.8. After that, we have another 'R.' That's my second 'r.'9. Finally, there's a 'Y,' but since Y can sometimes be considered a vowel in English, especially when it's at theend of a word like ""yellow,"" I think I should count it as an consonant here because we're specifically looking for'r.' Wait, does that mean there are two 'r's? Let me double-check. The word is S-T-R-A-W-B-E-R-R-Y. So R is in position3 and then again at the end after another R. Yes, that makes sense. Sometimes Y can be tricky because it's not avowel in this context. I'm pretty confident now that there are two 'r's in ""strawberry."" I should write that down as my final answer.</think> The word ""strawberry"" contains two 'r's: one at position 3 and another at the end, making it 14 letters long. Answer: There are two r's in the word strawberry.",2

My AMD Ryzen 5 8600G has 16 TOPS only and a 65 watts power limit. I have 64GB RAM which can be FULLY USED for inference. Inference is slow. Highly complex tasks (prompts) are running up to 5 minutes but even writing a well-structured prompt takes me more time. And the result saves me hours of work. The PC supports up to 128GB RAM, therefore running a 70B model should work perfectly when time is no issue. Due to the low power consumption there are no heat problems. So you trade speed against unlimited model size - for me that is the perfect solution, especially considering that this is a <$1,000 setup). Smaller models run naturally much faster!",0

Like, for image generators, it can show what images in its database it is scanning and using to help it generate the image from whatever prompt you type it!

The user was talking about using the API to remember preferences, and in my last response, I gave an example using GPT-4. Now they're questioning why I referred to GPT-4 and whether I am that model. First, I need to clarify my identity. The user is using the free version of ChatGPT, which is powered by GPT-3.5. But when discussing API examples, I mentioned GPT-4 because it's another model in OpenAI's lineup. I should explain that there are different models available through the API, like GPT-4, but the current chat interface they're using is based on GPT-3.5. Wait, the user might be confused because they see ""GPT-4"" in the example and assume that's what I am. I need to make it clear that in the API context, developers can choose different models, including GPT-4, but the version they're interacting with here is GPT-3.5 unless they have access to GPT-4 through a subscription or API. Also, I should mention that even though I used GPT-4 as an example in the API context, my own responses are generated by GPT-3.5. I need to ensure that the user understands the distinction between the different models and the platforms they're used on.",0

If a game had the tag ""open"" would you assume the game is open source? No, more like ""open-world"" or something. Why is the reasoning here any different, especially since OpenAI has never stated they were meant to be an opensource AI company, whatever that looks like. There aren't really any models truly open source, not llama, not stable diffusion.

Also, using [ ] instead of < > for the special syntax worked much better for me for some reason.Even as a 8b model, with these 2 simple tricks, can go toe-to-toe with (and sometimes beat) Chat-GPT-4o mini on easy-medium level math problems when both instructed to not show steps (only direct answer) nor use any tools (like python interpreter).For anyone who is going to try making one, don't even try using LLMs smaller than 3b parameters.

Even though the privacy policy aligns with global norms in terms of transparency, the regulatory environment in China grants broader authority to access data without requiring user consent or judicial oversight. This means your personal data, including inputs, could theoretically be accessed by the Chinese government.In contrast, OpenAI operates within U.S. and GDPR-aligned frameworks, which offer more robust protections and recourse for users in terms of how their data is handled and protected.If your primary concern is data sovereignty and security, DeepSeek’s Chinese jurisdiction is the main aspect that sets it apart from U.S.-based services.",0

You might think there’s some logic in that choosing, but there’s not. It’s still just Text-based pattern matching, choosing whichever output best matches training examples it has seen before. Doesn’t mean it can’t be insanely useful, but it’s never going to get us to the AGI or Superintelligence the tech bros keep promising. We will need a fundamentally new AI paradigm for that",211
